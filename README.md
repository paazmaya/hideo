This project is

 generates an report, one or more web pages, from directories of screen captures and a possible meta data, such as generated by `shigehachi`

## Background for the project name

The name of the project is for honouring the legacy of Mrs Sonobe Hideo (園部 秀雄),
who was the 15th head master of
[Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu (直心影流薙刀術)](https://naginata.fi/en/koryu),
which is an ancient Japanese martial art, focusing the handling of a long pole like weapon
called naginata.

[Read more about why these martial arts are important for me at `karatejukka.fi`.](https://karatejukka.fi)

## Getting started

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `14.15.0`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

The metrics input is expected to look something similar to, such as provided by [shigehachi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shigehachi) version 6 onwards:

```json
{
  "5317107e6e45bc44da564197e8478702": {
    "metric": "RootMeanSquaredError",
    "normalized": {
      "red": "0.0410206303",
      "green": "0.2454052653",
      "blue": "0.2478704718",
      "opacity": "0.3134753265",
      "total": "0.2353789431"
    },
    "absolute": {
      "red": "2688.3",
      "green": "16082.6",
      "blue": "16244.2",
      "opacity": "20543.6",
      "total": "15425.6"
    },
    "A": "tests/fixtures/prev/postcss.png",
    "B": "tests/fixtures/curr/postcss.png",
    "diff": "tests/fixtures/output/postcss-rmse-tint.png"
  }
}
```

The data collected by [`shigehachi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shigehachi) is basically gathering what GraphicsMagick tells when using its [`compare` utility](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/compare.html).

The resulting HTML site is build by using JavaScript [template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

## Command line options

The output of `hideo --help` pretty much covers all the options:

```sh
```
