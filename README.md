This tool generates an report, one or more web pages, from directories of screen captures and a possible meta data, such as generated by `shigehachi`

## Background for the name

The name of the project is for honouring the legacy of Mrs Sonobe Hideo (園部 秀雄),
who was the 15th head master of
[Jikishinkageryu Naginatajutsu (直心影流薙刀術)](https://naginata.fi/en/koryu),
which is an ancient Japanese martial art, focusing the handling of a long pole like weapon
called naginata.

## Getting started

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `8.11.1`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

The metrics input is expected to look something similar to, such as provided by shigehachi version 6 onwards:

```json
{
  "16bf19e046e752c8a14df3799befa102d8a30a0e": {
    "name": "Running PostCSS",
    "A": "tests/fixtures/prev/postcss.png",
    "B": "tests/fixtures/curr/postcss.png",
    "metric": "PeakAbsoluteError",
    "normalised": {
      "red": "0.1411764706",
      "green": "0.7882352941",
      "blue": "0.7960784314",
      "opacity": "1.0000000000",
      "total": "1.0000000000"
    }
  }
}
```

The resulting HTML site is build by using JavaScript [template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

## Command line options

The output of `hideo --help` pretty much covers all the options:

```sh
```
